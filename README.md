# OneClick Problem Solver

A web-based application that uses computer vision and AI to solve problems from images. Users can capture images using their device camera and get AI-powered solutions using Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash model.

## Features

- üì∑ **Camera Integration**: Capture images using front or back camera
- üîê **Secure Authentication**: Basic auth to retrieve API keys safely
- ü§ñ **AI-Powered**: Uses Google Gemini 2.0 Flash for problem solving
- üì± **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- ‚ö° **No Backend Required**: Runs entirely in the browser

## How It Works

1. **Login**: Enter credentials to authenticate and retrieve API access
2. **Capture**: Use your camera to take a photo of any problem
3. **Solve**: AI analyzes the image and provides the solution
4. **Repeat**: Continue solving problems with one-click capture
